# Quality Assurance Reports

This repository contains Quality Assurance (QA) reports provided by ChainSecurity for our clients.

ChainSecurity Quality Assurance focus on identifying potential high-impact security vulnerabilities within specific scopes of the clients protocol codebase. These are time-limited assessments and not full security audits.

Each report typically includes:
- The scope of the QA (specific commits or contracts).
- An overview of the functionality reviewed.
- Assessed risks.
- Properties checked during the QA.
- Findings (if any).
- Limitations of the report.

Quality assurance primarily serves as a quick check and a guidance for further more extensive security measures. It is especially suitable for code changes with limited impact on the overall security, even if implemented incorrectly, and for code in an early stage of development.
